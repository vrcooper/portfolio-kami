## Summary:
Bloc-Jams is a Spotify-inspired music player application built with jQuery and AngularJS

## Explanation:
Bloc-Jams is the front-end foundation curriculum project which teaches the basics of front-end development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and AngularJS.

## Problem:
1. As a developer, I want to bootstrap Angular to my application.  
2. As a developer, I want to configure routing and states for my application.  
3. As a developer, I want to implement controllers for my application's views.   
4. As a developer, I want to create a service that handles song playback.  
5. As a developer, I want to write a directive that controls song and volume sliders.  
6. As a developer, I want to add a time code filter to display time properly.

## Solution:
* Install NPM and Grunt
* Reference Angular script file
* Create templates
* Configure modules and states
* Created album, landing and collection controllers
* Injected fixture and song player services as dependencies
* Created seek bar directives and templates
* Created an Angular time code filter to format time display

## Results:
Working single page web application

## Conclusion:
This was my first web application refactored with AngularJS. The refactoring was often difficult and challenging but really taught the core concepts of using AngularJS.
